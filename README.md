### NodeJS - The Complete Guide

This repository is a companion to the Udemy course [NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide), designed to help you master Node.js by building real-world applications and understanding the fundamental and advanced concepts that power this powerful JavaScript runtime.

### What You Will Learn

- **Foundations of Node.js:**
    - Start with the basics of Node.js, understanding its core principles, the V8 engine, and how it leverages JavaScript on the server side.
    - Explore the Node.js event loop and learn how it handles asynchronous operations with non-blocking I/O, making it ideal for building scalable applications.

- **Working with Express.js:**
    - Dive into Express.js, the most popular web framework for Node.js, and learn how to build robust web applications and APIs with ease.
    - Master the art of middleware, routing, and templating engines to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

- **REST APIs and GraphQL:**
    - Gain expertise in building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, learning best practices for API design and security.
    - Explore GraphQL as an alternative to REST, and learn how to implement it in your Node.js applications for more flexible data querying.

- **Database Integration:**
    - Learn how to connect Node.js applications to both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) databases.
    - Use Mongoose for data modeling with MongoDB and understand how to perform CRUD operations efficiently.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Implement robust authentication systems using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth, securing your applications from unauthorized access.
    - Understand how to manage user roles and permissions, ensuring that your applications are both secure and user-friendly.

- **Advanced Node.js Concepts:**
    - Delve into advanced topics such as error handling, debugging, and performance optimization.
    - Learn about Node.js clustering and worker threads to build scalable applications that can handle heavy loads.

- **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Master the tools and techniques for testing Node.js applications, including unit tests with Mocha and Chai, and end-to-end tests with tools like Jest.
    - Learn how to debug your applications effectively, using tools like Node Inspector and Chrome DevTools.
